                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>The Bistro Cafe first opened its doors in November of 1972! Bit and Byte Smith 
                    were new to Techieville and discovered an empty building on the corner of 5th 
                    and Hypertext Avenue. They always dreamed of opening up their own restaurant. 
                    That dream came true in the Fall of 1972 when they purchased the building and 
                    began construction on The Bistro Cafe. In November of 1972, they were ready 
                    to open their doors. They decided to have a grand opening on Thanksgiving Day 
                    and offered a free turkey dinner to all who attended. This became a tradition 
                    that is still being followed to this day. Every Thanksgiving Day, The Bistro 
                    Cafe opens its doors and serves a free turkey dinner.</p>

                <p>In 1994, Bit and Byte decided it was time to retire. They turned over the reins 
                    of the Cafe to their son, Chip. Chip continues to manage the Cafe today with the 
                    help of his wife, Drive. Chip and Drive have added a few of their own special 
                    recipes to the menu. But for the most part, the menu hasn't change too much from 
                    the original one. The Bistro Cafe went through a major remodel in 2002. A private 
                    party room was added which can handle groups up to 40 people. If you would like to 
                    plan a private party at The Bistro Cafe, please contact Chip or Drive at the 
                    restaurant.</p>
